        "question": "What services do you offer?",
        "answer": "We offer two core solutions: Creative Subscription (CaaS) and Talent-as-a-Service (TaaS). Creative Subscription covers all recurring content creation such as design, video, presentation, and localization ‚Äî delivered through a monthly slot-based plan. Talent-as-a-Service provides dedicated professionals or creative teams to support your brand long-term."
      },
      "1": {
        "question": "How does the subscription work?",
        "answer": "Each subscription equals one or more active slots. A slot is a dedicated workflow handled by a PM and creative team. Once you subscribe, you can submit unlimited requests through Notion, and your PM will queue, assign, and deliver projects continuously within your active slot. Add more slots anytime for parallel projects."
      },
      "2": {
        "question": "What's the turnaround time for projects?",
        "answer": "Typical delivery times: Design projects in 48 hours, Video & Motion in 3‚Äì5 days, Presentation & Reports in 2‚Äì4 days, and Content localization within 24‚Äì48 hours. Complex or multi-slot projects will be scheduled by your PM for balanced output speed."
      },
      "3": {
        "question": "How many projects can I work on at once?",
        "answer": "Each active slot runs one project at a time. You can submit unlimited requests to your queue ‚Äî once a project is completed, the next one automatically begins. Multiple slots allow simultaneous production (e.g., 2 slots = design + video at once)."
      },
      "4": {
        "question": "What if I don't like the design or result?",
        "answer": "Every plan includes unlimited revisions within your active slot. Our PM reviews your feedback, coordinates revisions with the creative team, and continues refining until you're fully satisfied ‚Äî no extra cost, no time limit."
      },
      "5": {
        "question": "Can I pause my subscription?",
        "answer": "Yes, absolutely. You can pause your plan anytime. While paused, your billing stops, and you can reactivate when ready ‚Äî ideal for seasonal campaigns or when you don't have ongoing creative work."
      },
      "6": {
        "question": "Do I own the rights to the work?",
        "answer": "Yes, 100%. All design files, documents, videos, and source materials we produce are fully yours. Copyright and commercial usage rights are transferred to you upon delivery."
      },
      "7": {
        "question": "What tools and platforms do you use?",
        "answer": "We primarily use Figma, Adobe Creative Suite, After Effects, and DaVinci Resolve for design and motion work. For collaboration, we operate through Notion, Slack, and Google Drive. You'll have direct access to monitor progress and provide feedback anytime."
      },
      "8": {
        "question": "Is there a minimum commitment?",
        "answer": "No minimum commitment. All plans operate on 30-day terms with flexible renewals. You can subscribe monthly, quarterly, or semi-annually ‚Äî whichever suits your workflow best."
      },
      "9": {
        "question": "How do I submit requests?",
        "answer": "Once onboarded, you'll receive access to your Notion workspace where you can create tasks, upload files, and set priorities. Your dedicated PM will manage the workflow, assign the right designer or editor, and keep updates transparent through Notion or Slack."
